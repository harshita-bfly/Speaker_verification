# Overview

Speaker verification utilizes speech characteristics to validate the speakerâ€™s identity. It has become increasingly important in security, where it is employed in several applications, including access control, monetary transactions, and safe communication, to authenticate people. This project focuses on verifying the speakers based on their voices. The speakers are famous Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant, and Alexa. Text-To-Speech (TTS) technology is often used to create these virtual assistants' voices. As a result, these virtual speech assistants lack the natural variances in human voices. In this study, transfer learning is used to modify current speaker recognition model so they can recognize synthetic sounds generated using TTS technology.
